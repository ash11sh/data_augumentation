Training deep-learning models with more diverse data-set implies towards its accuracy. It prevents model from being over-fit. Augmentation multiplies the data-set by applying few transformation techniques like:

* crop
* flip
* Normalise 
* Resizing
* Padding
* color transform
* rotating

We'll see how pytorch can be used in the data augumentation process.
